Blackjack Rules
The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 in card value as possible
without going over that number and to beat the dealer's hand.
Card values start at 2 for a two of any suite, and increment up to 10 for tens and face cards.
Aces value can be either 11 or 1 but start as 11 unless the players hand value is above 21.

1. Place your bet using your score
2. Ace values adjusted automatically if your hand value is over 21
3. Choose from a host of game options: Hit, Stand, Rules, Exit
    3.1. Hit: Draw a card, game checks your hand value and aces count
        3.1.1. If hand value over 21, check if any aces left to convert
            3.1.1.1 If no aces to convert left, you lose!
            3.1.1.2 If there are, convert 1 ace value to 1
    3.2. Stand: Pass turn to next player
    3.3. Rules: This handy dandy file!
    3.4. Exit: Leaves the game

Have fun!
