## Purpose
The application will be a playable card game using Texas Holdem rules with a deck of the standard playing cards of Ranks and Suits.

It will solve people's need for entertainment. I am developing it both to fill that need and develop my ruby programming/testing skills.

The target audience are those that enjoy card games of this nature.

A member of the target audience will use this app to entertain themselves by playing games of Texas Holdem either against other players on the same machine or against computer opponents that will have predefined behaviours. They can navigate the menus/options using their arrow keys and enter details when creating their player object or when making their bets.
